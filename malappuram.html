            A small hangout place for families and friends.Beautiful hill top area. But most of the hill area is destroyed by quarries.Within a few year, the hill will not be seen there.Authorities must do something to protect this area if they have any plan to develop the tourism.Plastic depositing is another issue faced here.Any how within the limits, this area is beautiful as it is.
