            One of the most famous pilgrim centres in India is the Sabarimala Temple. It is situated on the mountain ranges of the Western Ghats at an altitude of 914 m above sea level and is accessible only by foot from Pamba (4 km). The temple is dedicated to the Hindu deity Sree Ayyappa. <br>
            Pilgrim season is from November to mid-January. Mandalapooja and Makaravilakku are the two main events of the pilgrim season. The Temple stays closed during the rest of the year except for the first five days of every Malayalam month and during Vishu (April).

            <h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">KONNI-ADAVI ECO TOURISM CENTRE</h5>
            Come to the elephant-training centre at Konni. You wouldnâ€™t realize hours flying by as you watch the naughty little pranks a calf makes while it is taken to the river for a bath.  For more excitement, get in to a bowl boating at Adavi and sail through the water rimmed with lust green forest on either side. <br>
            Perhaps the river is a place for more excitement. Get into a Kottavanchi (bowl boat/coracle boat) at Adavi and sail through the water rimmed with lust green forest on either side.  Perhaps not today. They might be well inside, merrily lazing around in the shades. How about a walk in the woods?

            Gavi Eco-Tourism , a project of the Kerala Forest Development Corporation, has caught the attention of tourists for a while now. The project is exclusive in many respects and the majority who visited were nature lovers and adventure tourists. Over a short period of time visitors to Gavi gradually increased, especially after 'Alistair International' the world acclaimed tourism major listed it among the leading eco-tourism centres and one of the must-see places in India. A highlight of the Gavi Eco Project is the involvement of the local populace in its activities as guides, gardeners and cooks. This provides livelihood for the locals and also helps to create awareness on the conservation of nature. Gavi, located in Pathanamthitta district offers its visitors activities like trekking, wildlife watching, outdoor camping in specially built tents and night safaris.
