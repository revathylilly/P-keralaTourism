            <h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">ARAKKAL MUSEUM</h5>
            The Arakkal Museum is a museum dedicated to the Arakkal family, the only Muslim royal family in Kerala, India. The museum is actually a section of the Arakkalkettu (Arakkal Royal Palace). The durbar hall section of the palace has been converted into a museum by the Government of Kerala. It was opened in July 2005 after a Rs. 9,000,000 renovation.

Although renovated by the government, the Arakkalkettu is still owned by the Arakkal Royal Trust and does not fall under the control of the country's archaeology department, the Archaeological Survey of India. The government had taken a keen interest in preserving the heritage of the Arakkal Family, which had played a prominent role in the history of Malabar. A nominal entry fee is charged by the Arakkal Royal Trust from visitors to the museum.

vMuzhapillangad drive-in beach is easily one of the prettiest beaches in India, and a definite must visit. It is the longest drive in beach across Asia, and being here with your car is an absolute delight for every driving enthusiast. In fact, Muzhapillangad is what tempted us to embark on a road trip from Mumbai, and in the process, experience the absolute delight that Kannur is. The sands on the beach are very clean and sheer, the views extremely picturesque, and you can simply go rampant on the instagram handle. The best time to be here is early morning (the beach opens at 6 am) and you would find minimal traffic around. Evenings should also be nice, but the no of cars are far more then.
