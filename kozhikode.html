            Kozhikode will always have a special place in the history of Kerala as it is here that Vasco-da-Gama first landed and the legendarySpice Route came into existence. This region still has a historic charm to it. Kozhikode Beach is the personification of the numerous characteristics that make Kozhikode so unique.
            People flock in large numbers to view the sunset from the beach. One gets a fresh supply of seafood in the shacks that surround the place. Kallumekaya (mussels) is a local favourite. A walk to Dolphins Point at dawn ensures a meeting with playful dolphins. You are also greeted by a majestic lighthouse and two piers opening into the sea. Both have been here for over a hundred years. Children flock to Lions Park and the nearby marine water aquarium which is open on all days from 08:00 hrs to 20:00 hrs.

            The area near Thikkoti Lighthouse is soaked in the natural beauty of lush green coconut & palm plantation with Velliyamkally Rock on one side and scintillating blue sea on the other. It was built over a shipwreck, whose remains can still be seen here. The people love visiting this place for its natural beauty and for migratory birds that keep visiting this place mostly during winter. Thikkoti Lighhouse is definitely one of the most fascinating remain from the ancient Kozhikode as the same was built on the remains of a shipwreck that crashed near the rocky shore of the Payyoli beach.

            <h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">PAZHASSI RAJA MUSEUM AND ART GALLERY</h5>
            The museum and the art gallery are named after the great Pazhassi Raja, born Kerala Varma of the Padinjare Kovilakom of the Kottayam Royal Family. The famous 'Pazhassi Revolt' (against the British East India Company during the second half of the 1700s) was led by Pazhassi Raja. Nicknamed the Lion of Kerala, Pazhassi Raja is also credited with introducing guerrilla warfare in the hills of Wayanad to resist the increasingly intolerable British colonialism. This great freedom fighter was shot dead in an encounter on 30 November 1805. <br>
            The museum is managed by the State Archaeology Department and has on display mural paintings, antique bronzes, ancient coins, models of temples, umbrella stones, dolmenoid cists (quadrangular burial chambers with capstones), and similar megalithic monuments.
